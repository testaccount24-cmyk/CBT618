           Prompting will occur for hlq and optional volser.

           and it will then issue the TSO RECEIVE command for the
           the following members to create these new data sets:

           Member       Dataset
           ASM          hlq.ASM
           EXEC         hlq.EXEC
           LOAD         hlq.LOAD
           PANELS       hlq.PANELS
           ZLIB         hlq.ZLIB

           You will then need to copy these datasets/members into
           datasets for production use.

           After these data sets are created several of the members
           of this install data set will be browsed.
