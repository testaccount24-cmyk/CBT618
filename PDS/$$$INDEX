SAM, hi again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a little application that calls the CRYPTOGRAPHIC ICSF API'S.
All the programs are in REXX

You need access to keys and to the ICSF

The programs are in xmit format in member XEXEC
The panels are in xmit format in member XPLIB
The messages are in xmit format in member XMLIB

You only have to start with the REXX PCSF and follow the panels
Nota: you have to put your CKDS and your PKDS in program PCSF
      and all the application works with your files

------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to this, there are the next programs too

   In order to create asymetric keys, I put several keys RSA in the
   members:
              RSA11024
              RSA1512  ---> see this first
              RSA21024
              RSA31024
              RSA41024
              RSA51024
              RSA61024
              RSA71024
              RSA81024
              RSA91024
   This keys are in assembler format for use with a program that
   put them in the PKDS
   You can use program RSACREA changing the member that use to
   put the key inthe PKDS, and the key label, who is RSAPRU.

 . Other programs

   1   Generate random numbers
       COBOL example: randomc
       ASML example:  randoma

   2   Create symetric keys using API   KEY GENERATE
       The program in COBOL:   DESCRECB
       The program in ASM:     DESCREAS
       With the JCL:           CREASIM

   3   Create symetric keys using RANDOM GENERATOR and IMPORT
       The program in COBOL:   DESRANCB
       The program in ASM:     DESRANAS

   4   Signatures
       5.1    RSADSS1 create the key RSADSS for signatures
              RSADSS2 make a signature from a text and verify it.

You can compile all the assembler programs using the proc ASMCOMP
You can compile all the cobol programs using the proc COBCOMP
